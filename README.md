 Metaverse Transactions Dashboard – Data Analysis Report
1.Project Description
This dashboard provides insights into user activity and transaction behavior in a metaverse environment. It aims to detect anomalies, understand session patterns, and highlight potential risks related to transaction types, regions, and user profiles.

2.Objectives
Analyze how session durations correlate with login frequency

Understand transaction distribution by type (e.g., purchase, scam, transfer)

Identify high-risk anomalies and suspicious patterns

Categorize behavior based on user age groups and regions

Help stakeholders monitor spending and fraud

3.Key Metrics
*Total Amount Spent: 39.46M
*Total Transactions: 78.51K
*Transaction Types: purchase, sale, transfer, phishing, scam
*Anomalies Tracked: high_risk, moderate_risk, low_risk
*Age Groups Analyzed: new, established, veteran

4.Key Insights
*Login Frequency vs Session Duration:
*More frequent logins are associated with longer session durations.
*This suggests engaged users (possibly veterans or repeat customers) spend more time in the metaverse environment.

Transaction Type Breakdown:
*sale and purchase dominate (31–32% each)
*transfer is significant (~28%)
*scam and phishing are smaller in volume but critical for anomaly detection

Anomaly Patterns:
*High-risk activities are mostly tied to specific months (e.g., March, August)
*Some wallets (addresses) appear repeatedly with different risk levels

Regional Distribution:
*Users from North America, Asia, and Europe dominate transaction volumes
*Regional breakdown helps identify where scams or high-risk behaviors are more prevalent

Age Group Behavior:
*Veteran users may show consistent spending patterns
*New and Established users may show volatile or irregular activity

5. Dashboard Features
KPI Tiles: Total Spend, Total Transactions

Stacked Bar Chart: Session Duration by Login Frequency

Pie Chart: Amount by Transaction Type

Matrix/Table: Anomaly trends by Month and Wallet Address

Slicers: Transaction Type, Region, Age Group, Anomaly Type

6. Recommendations
*Closely monitor repeat high-risk sending addresses
*Investigate transactions labeled as scam or phishing, especially if clustered in certain regions
*Offer targeted security measures or verification steps for users with low login frequency but high spend
*Encourage new users to follow safer purchase patterns via onboarding or in-app notifications
